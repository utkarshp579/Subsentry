# Week 4 Base Files (Issues 11–15)

This folder is the Week 4 snapshot. It starts from Week 3 and continues the project into analytics and insight-driven features.

## Week 4 Goal

Week 4 is about turning raw subscription data into **meaningful insight**. The UI and backend should start answering questions like “How much do I spend monthly?” rather than just listing subscriptions.

## ✅ Issues Covered (Current)

### Issue 11: Auth Landing Page (Competitive)

- Build a premium landing experience for sign-in and sign-up.
- Strong visual branding, modern layout, and responsive composition.

### Issue 12: Monthly Spend Calculation

- Normalize all subscriptions into monthly spend.
- Handle mixed billing cycles safely.

### Issue 13: Yearly Spend Calculation

- Aggregate yearly spend across subscriptions.
- Keep logic clean and reusable from monthly math.
